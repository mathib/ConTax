<h2>Abstract</h2>
<span class="markdown">
The ConTax ontology contains additional terminology for structuring and annotating RDFS/OWL taxonomies for describing constructions (components, materials, spatial zones, damages, construction tasks and properties). It also functions as an index for known taxonomies starting from root classes and properties. </span>
<p style="text-align: center;">
	The namespace for ConTax terms is <span class="repeated" style="font-family: courier;">https://w3id.org/con-tax#</span>

<p style="text-align: center;">
	The suggested prefix for the ConTax namespace is <span class="repeated" style="font-family: courier;">contax</span>
